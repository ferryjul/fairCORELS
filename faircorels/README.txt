Welcome to FairCorels, a Python library for learning fair and interpretable models
using the Certifiably Optimal RulE ListS (CORELS) algorithm! 

FairCORELS uses Python, Numpy, GMP, and a C++ compiler.
GMP (GNU Multiple Precision library) is not required, but it is *highly recommended*, as it improves performance. 
If it is not installed, CORELS will run slower.
