--- Experiments for the COMPAS dataset:
- General information
maximum memory use of 4 Go
several time limits, values of epsilon
20 random subsets of 90% of the whole dataset as training set
all experiments launched on a computing platform using homogeneous nodes with Intel Xeon CPUs of Broadwell generation

- FairCORELS config:
lambda 1e-3
min_support 0.01

- Dataset preprocessing:
sensitive attributes: race_caucasian vs race_african_american
preproc: remove examples not in sensitive or unsensitive groups
rule mining: 1 rule = 1 attr, one-hot for categorical, quantiles (5 bins) for numerical, min_support = 0.0
-> 16 binary rules
sensitive attributes not used for inference

--- Experiments for the GERMAN CREDIT dataset:
- General information
maximum memory use of 4 Go
several time limits, values of epsilon
20 random subsets of 90% of the whole dataset as training set
all experiments launched on a computing platform using homogeneous nodes with Intel Xeon CPUs of Broadwell generation

- FairCORELS config:
lambda 1e-3
min_support 0.2

- Dataset preprocessing:
sensitive attributes: age_high vs age_low
rule mining: 1 rule = 1 attr (min_support = 0.25) or conjunction of two attributes (min_support = 0.5), one-hot for categorical, quantiles (2 bins) for numerical, 
-> 47 binary rules
sensitive attributes not used for inference (idem gender_male and gender_female)
